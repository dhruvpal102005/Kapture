### Run Tracking Flow
```
1. User starts run → GPS tracking begins
2. Location updates → Route polyline drawn
3. Loop detected → Area calculated (Shoelace formula)
4. Run finished → Stats saved to Firebase
5. Leaderboard updated → Rankings recalculated
```

### Data Models
- **Users**: Profile info, follower/following counts
- **Runs**: Route coordinates, distance, duration, captured area
- **Posts**: Status updates, polls, timestamps
- **Follows**: Follower/following relationships
- **Clubs**: Club info, members, pending applications
